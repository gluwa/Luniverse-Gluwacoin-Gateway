# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

It is recommended to send the report to
security@gluwa.com (and obviously not to discuss the
issue anywhere else). 

Examples for details to include:

- Ideally a short description (or a script) to demonstrate an
  exploit.
- The affected platforms and scenarios (the vulnerability might
  only affect setups with case-sensitive file systems, for
  example).
- The name and affiliation of the security researchers who are
  involved in the discovery, if any.
- Whether the vulnerability has already been disclosed.
- How long an embargo would be required to be safe.
